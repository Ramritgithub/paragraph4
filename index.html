         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Companies have undergone a process of transformation, organizing themselves
to be able to make effective and agile responses to environmental problems
and, especially, those having to do with competition and positioning in the
market. These responses constitute a set of actions or activities that reflect the
company’s competence in taking advantage of opportunities, and their capacity
for rapid action, respecting time and cost limits and specifications (Rabechini
& Carvalho, 2003). To do so, constructing project-oriented organizations and
investing in management design tools and techniques is fundamental, and this
has become a growing concern of companies.
Handy (1995) points out that organizations in the postindustrial era will be
configured like “condominiums”, with groups of projects housed together,
since what adds the most value to products and services are intelligent, rather
than routine, activities (Fleury & Fleury, 2000).
According to Frame (1999), project management practices have consolidated
since the 1990s, and several researchers cite this as an obligatory subject<p>
      
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;matter for companies that seek to develop and maintain competitive advantages. A good indicator of this growth is the presence of the PMI (Project
Management Institute) in over 100 countries; it has certified around 25,000
project managers since the beginning of 2002 (Rabechini and Carvalho, 2003).
However, studies based in Brazilian companies show that few have formalized
development of a management model for the process of innovation and projects
(Rabechini et al., 2002).
The main concepts related to project management and the ways that a company
can structure itself to reach maturity in its projects will be discussed in this
chapter. The alignment between strategy and project management structure is
also addressed.

          In Chapter VIII, a decision problem was presented by three levels of decision:
(1) strategic decisions — which refer to the long-range goals and the policies
for resource allocation; (2) tactical decisions — referring to the acquisition and
efficient utilization of resources in the accomplishment of organizational goals;
and (3) operational decisions — concerning the efficient and effective execution of specific tasks. In that chapter, we have noted that the main character-

   <i> Today, an organization is not interested only in the best alternative of decision
(for instance, the alternative that provides highest profit), but it is interested in
knowing a set of good enough or best possible alternatives considering multiple
criteria such as quality aspects, labor benefits, environmental risk, and so on.
Therefore it is often necessary to analyze each alternative in light of its potential
impact on several goals. In mathematical methods used to handle multiple goals
(such as Utility Theory, Goal Programming, Multiple Objective Linear Programming), it is usually difficult to obtain an explicit statement of the organization’s
goals because the relationship between alternatives and their impact on goals
may be difficult to quantify. To understand complex models and to enable
flexibility and adaptation to changing conditions for different decision-making
situations, the procedure of sensitivity analysis adopted by software of</i>
Decision Support System (DSS), Expert System (ES), and Artificial Intelligence (Nilsson, 1970; Nilsson, 1998) techniques, is recommended.

        <p class="b">Exploiting Solutions Using<br>
            Expert Systems </p> 
    <div class="line"></div>
          
   Seeking out and refining solutions to problems formulated by mathematical
models, such as linear programming or dynamic programming, is neither
efficient nor sufficient to obtain new knowledge about problems in the real
world. Heuristic techniques are appropriate for obtaining near-optimal solutions in complex problems. Nevertheless, the solutions obtained by simple
heuristic methods need to be improved through the procedure known as metaheuristic techniques (Cook & Russel, 1993; Hillier & Liebermann, 1980) <p>
    Some of the better known meta-heuristic techniques are: simulated annealing,
tabu search, genetic algorithm, neural network, and so on (Turban & Arsonson,
1998; Takefuji ,1996).<p>An Artificial intelligence technique known as expert systems is recommended
for solving complex problems from the real world, which takes into consideration inferences with qualitative as well as quantitative variables. In the section
titled Application of an expert system, there is an example that illustrates the
application of the expert system in a simple problem involving two conflicting
criteria.</p>
    
This model evaluates and proposes distinct management strategies depending
on the type of project. According to Sabbag (1999), “different projects result
in different cubes. For example, a road building project or a typical building
construction, normally demonstrates high narrowness with regard to objectives
and lower complexity and singularity.” On the other hand, “A typical research
and development project or one to develop new software, can instead display
high singularity and complexity, but show low narrowness of objectives”
(Rabechini & Carvalho, 2003).<p>
For Maximiano (1997), projects can be divided into four large categories
according to their uncertainty and complexity. The higher degree of unknown,
the greater the uncertainty and the greater the associated risk. Complexity can
be evaluated through the degree of multi-disciplinarily needed for project
execution, the diversity and volume of information to be processed, and the
number of organizations involved, among other aspects.
Information is stored in the form of sentences called production or decision

    <div class="line"></div>
      
   &nbsp;&nbsp;According to Patah and Carvalho (2002), organizational structure should be
dynamic, i.e., capable of rapid changes if the environment demands them.
External factors involved can be an increase in competition in the market niche,
a change in technology, or even the unpredictability of demand.
The traditional organization, called functional, is marked by divisions by
departments, and displays some positive aspects, such as greater controllability
and minimal internal conflict. Each department displays high technical dominion
and facilitated internal communications, since each functionary reports to a
director. Nevertheless, with the growing diversification demanded by the<p>
          market, it has become ever more difficult to manage projects inside companies
with functional organization, since this system tends to serve the point of view
of a department and not the point of view of the client.
Projectized and matrix structures arose as an alternative to the rigidity of the
functional organizational structure. The matrix structure is a combination of the
functional and project structures and can be divided into weak, balanced, and
strong matrix (Patah & Carvalho, 2002). The main advantages and disadvantages of these two structures are summarized in Table 4.1.
<p>

structures</i>

      </div><br>
      
      <div class="first"><p>
          According to Kerzner (2001), in order to choose the most appropriate
organizational structure to organize project activity, some factors that influence
the decision should be considered: project size, duration, the organization’s
experience in managing projects, the philosophy of the company’s upper
management regarding project management, the physical location of the
project, available resources, and specific project aspects.
Meredith and Mantel (2000) summed up the process of choosing an organizational structure for a project in six steps:
1. Define the specific results desired from the project;<p>
2. Determine the key tasks for achieving the defined results and identify
which company departments need to be involved;<p>
3. Sequence and group key tasks in a logical fashion;<p>
4. Determine to which project subsystem the task groups will be allocated;
5. Identify special project and company features that affect the manner in
which the project should be organized;<p>
6. Consider the above information in making the final decision in relation to
the pros and cons of each type of organizational structure.<br>
          When the organizational structure is not selected in an appropriate manner,
several problems can be diagnosed. According to Patah and Carvalho (2002b)
some factors are indicative of problems, such as: projects don’t manage to meet
time, cost, and other requirements; experts feel under-utilized; no one takes
responsibility when the project tends toward failure; among others.
Mintzberg and Heyden (1999) warn, however, that organizational charts
sometimes do not adequately reflect how people really organize at work. These
authors present a new kind of organizational mapping called the organigraph
which introduces new components called hubs and webs, in addition to the
already used set and chain, as described in Figure 4.1.
For these authors, the new components — hubs and webs — can be defined
in the following way:<p>
           &nbsp;&nbsp;  1. Creating a degree with a consistent list of course offerings and
requirements on which colleges could mutually agree. All of the
colleges offered all of the courses that would be part of the online
Associate of Applied Science in Business. However, for some colleges the new online degree required giving up one or two courses
from their current business degrees. For other colleges, the new
online degree obligated them to accept new courses that were not
required in their current business degrees.<p>
Example: Selecting Companies Using Two Criteria (adapted from
Negoita,1985)<p>
         <i> A hub serves as a coordinating center. It is any physical or
conceptual point at which people, things, or information move.</i>

          <p class="b">Project Management Office (PMO)</p>
          <div class="line"></div><p>
          Four evolutions of the PMO model are proposed by Dinsmore (1998), Project
Support Office (PSO), Project Management Center of Excellence (PMCOE),
Program Management Office (PrgMO) and the Chief Project Officer (CPO).
These models run from a simple sector to help project control (PSO) to a
company department where all projects managed by the organization pass
through (Patah et al., 2003).
When an organization undertakes autonomous projects, the project management function stays within the project itself. The source of information on
project-management practices, in this case, comes from earlier experience and
that of the project leaders. All costs for the project team are allocated to the
project. The organization does not provide support and all project management
functions are realized by the project team itself. The function of this kind of
PMO is to manage the project in all its integrity. Thus, total responsibility for
project success resides with the project managerThe PSO provides technical and administrative support, tools and services to
various project managers simultaneously, aiding in planning, programming, and
dealing with changes of scope and in managing costs of the projects.<p> The
resources involved, both internal and external, are allocated to the projects
depending on the nature and contractual structure of each. Sometimes PSO
personnel are loaned to a project during its start up phase or even for the longterm. Responsibility for project success does not lie with the PSO, but with the
project managers who use its services.<p> </div><br>

      <div class="first"><p>
          The CPO’s responsibility is to care for and nourish the company’s project
portfolio from the stage of business decision through final implementation.
Among its activities, the CPO is responsible for the following: involvement in
business decisions that result in new projects; strategic business planning;
establishing priorities and negotiating resources for projects; supervising the
implementation of strategic projects; assuming responsibility for the project
management system at the company level; development of sensitization and
project management capacities throughout the organization; periodic project
evaluations, including the decision to discontinue them; managing the high level
stakeholders; and facilitation and mentoring.<p>
Verzuh (1999) also presents a classification of five different types of PMO:
• Center for Excellence;<p>
• Project Support Office;<p>
• Project Management Office;<p>
• Program Management Office;<p>
• Accountable Project Office.<p>
The main purpose of a center of excellence is to maintain standards for project
management and to promote their use in the organization. Despite the team
frequently being called upon to lend consultation, it does not have a direct role
in decision-making about the project. <p>Instead, its authority within the organization derives almost exclusively from its knowledge of project management
abilities. This means that, in addition to their knowledge, team members also
have to be capable agents of change, persuasively offering advice to members
of the organization at all levels.
In addition to maintaining and promoting project management standards and
practices, the project support office (PSO) actively support a number of
projects by, for example, creating and updating the project plan or its budget.
Made up of planning analysts, the PSO is responsible for maintaining exact
control while having responsibility for decisions about profit and loss. These
planning analysts often become project managers. This means that contributing
more project managers to the organization’s pool of talent is another contribution of the<p><i> PSO.A project management office (PMO) can offer support in creating schedules</i>
and budgets in the same way as a PSO. The main difference is that the PMO<p>
      will provide project managers for all the organization’s projects. Thus the PMO
becomes a long-term base for those who want to make a career in project
management. Due to being made up of many project managers, the PMO is able
to reinforce project management standards. Despite PMOs being responsible
for managing the salaries and professional growth of their project managers,
they are not responsible for the success or failure of the project. This
responsibility lies with the organization to which the project manager is
allocated. On the other hand, if a company develops a series of failed projects,
the PMO will also be held responsible, since it is the source of the company’s
knowledge of project management</p></div><br>
      <div class="first"><p>
          Programs are a series of related projects. The main difference is that programs
are so long that they develop some operational routines inside themselves. The
role of the program management office is to provide knowledge in project
management for the entire program, through the union of all projects together.
The large program management office will have teams that carry out various
project management functions such as scheduling, budgeting, and risk management. Like the PSO, the program management office is not directly responsible for meeting schedules and budgets; its role is mostly putting good
management practices and projects into use and then supporting them. Differently than the PSO, the program management office participates in project
decision-making. In contrast to the other form of project office, the program
management office has a use life, i.e. it will be dismounted after the project is
finished.<p>
The accountable project office is the oldest, but in some cases, the most
radical model of project office. Despite its being commonly referred to simply
as the project office it is called the accountable project office to distinguish
it from the other forms presented. It is called this because it has total
responsibility for scheduling and for the quality and cost goals of the projects
delegated to it. Like the project management office, it is a long-term sector for
project managers, providing them with a career model and administrative
management. It is made up of project managers and project support personnel.
It is worth stressing that, even though the PMO models appear to be
evolutionary, they can have a stronger adherence to a specific type of
organization depending on the role of project management in the type of
corporate strategy.<p>
It would be a mistake to think of the various project office forms as a
progression that all companies should follow. This would suggest that a center
for excellence is only the beginning and that the natural and proper evolution<p>would always be in the direction of an accountable project office with
responsibility for managing all project. This is an error common to all systems
of thought with large projection, to think that if something is good, more is
necessarily better. Instead, the project office should reflect the organizational
structure and the allocation of projects inside the organization. The mere
existence of a project office, no matter what type, represents a commitment
on the part of the organization to improve project management. The most
successful project offices specialize in both project management and evangelism, that is, they fight for their values (Verzuh, 1999).

          The implementation of formal efficiency procedures is quite new in IT projects.
There are different approaches regarding the best practices in the IT project
management (Carvalho et al., 2003; Laurindo et al., 2003).
Humphrey (1989) identifies maturity levels in the IT project development
process, based on the managerial behavior found in companies. The fundamental concepts of the maturity process derive from the belief that the development
management process is evolutionary. Paulk et al. (1995) identify the distinguishing characteristics between immature and mature organizations, as shown
in Table 4.2.<br><br>
         <p><i>Table 4.2. Immature organization mature organization (Paulk et al.,
1995)</i><p>
          <img src="Screenshot%202024-02-08%20163739.png"><p>The CMM (Humphrey, 1989; Paulk et al., 1995; Pessôa and Spinola, 1997)
was developed by SEI — the Software Engineering Institute, of Carnegie
Mellon University, and presents five maturity levels, each corresponding to a
set of structural requirements for key process areas. (Figure 4.2)
Although each project is unique, it could be organized in a process to be applied
in other projects. IT projects managers used to apply a “methodology,” i.e. they
establish the steps to be followed in order to develop a system. Another singular
characteristic is the dynamic technologies breakthrough that demands continuous improvements in the development methods and management of changing
process, as described in CMM model, at level 5, the highest level of maturity.</p>
          </div><br>
      <div class="first"><p>
          The CMM second level has a consistent project management structure and the
goal of this level is to deliver projects on time. To perform this, the model have
several points that must be achieved, like effort and size estimation, strong
process control (such as periodic meetings between technical people and
managers), and several measures to show project status more clearly.
CMM is not an adequate reference for the assessment of internal methodologies, since it was not conceived to perform this kind of analysis. ISO 15504
(1998) proposed the standard project SPICE as a more appropriated model
to evaluate maturity level of specific processes. While CMM level of maturity
specifies a set of processes that have to be performed, ISO 15504 establishes
maturity levels for each individual process: level 0-incomplete; level 1-performed; level 2-managed; level 3-established; level 4-predictable; level 5-
optimizing. This is a different approach of CMM, since an organization does not
perform a maturity level, but has a maturity profile: a maturity level is measured
for each specific process. This new approach is a very useful to the organization<p>
          <img src="Screenshot%202024-02-08%20163758.png"><p>
          perspective because one can easily measure strong and weak points of their
process and plan improvement activities. Furthermore, from the companie’s
point of view, it is easier to understand staged levels as the performed
processes are already predefined.
The SPICE approach defined in standard ISO 15504 (1998) had originally
influenced CMM for Systems Engineering, published in 1995, and more
recently influenced CMM I (CMM-I1; CMM-I2), just published in 2002.
CMM-I, the integration model, was enhanced in two dimensions: scope
dimension and evaluation dimension.
In the scope dimension, this new model incorporated other published models
and covers all project activities, not only software, as the original software
CMM did, but also other engineering fields. In the evaluation dimension,
CMM-Il incorporated both approaches: the traditional (called staged CMM)
and the maturity profile (called continuous CMM). Figure 4.3 shows the
continuous CMM-I representation to be compatible with ISO/IEC 15504
standard.
          </p></div><br>
      <div class="first"><p>
          CMM-I (and software CMM) considers that maturity level is an organizational
characteristic and it is independent of the professionals involved. Nowadays,
there is a strong tendency towards the adoption of CMM-I models, which were
sponsored by Department of Defense (DoD), meanwhile, ISO standards are
less used.<br><i>Figure 4.3. Continuous maturity process representation in CMM-I (adapted

          <br><p class="b">Project Management Maturity Model (PMMM)</p>
          <div class="line"></div><p>
          Project Management plays an important role in the competitive scenario, and
achieved in the 1990s the status of methodology. The model proposed by
Project Management Institute - PMI (2000), called Project Management Body
of Knowledge (PMBoK), provides a framework to manage project efficiency,
balancing scope expectations and the available resources in nine key areas
(Rabechini & Carvalho, 1999).<p>
Nevertheless, the PMBoK framework cannot provide a standard benchmark
for project management capability as CMM to software engineering capabilities. In order to extend the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) to project
management, Kerzner (2000, 2001) proposes a Project Management Maturity
Model (PMMM).<p>
The PMMM differs in many aspects from the CMM, but this framework also
introduces benchmarking instruments for measuring an organization’s progress
along the maturity model, detailing five levels of development for achieving
maturity, as shown in Figure 4.4 (Carvalho et al., 2003).
It is important to highlight the differences in terminology between the CMM and
PMMM, (compare Figures 4.3 and 4.4) which could lead to misunderstanding
when both models are being implemented in the IT domain of the same
organization<p>
          </p></div><br>
      <div class="first"><p>
          <i>Figure 4.4. Project Management Maturity Model (adapted from Kerzner,

          <img src="Screenshot%202024-02-08%20224614.png"><p>
          PMMM addresses the key knowledge areas across the project management
process, in compliance with PMBoK, and integrates them with the Project
Management Office — PMO in the strategic level.
Kerzner (2000) identifies a life cycle in PMMM level 2, common processes,
which could be broken into five phases, as shown in Figure 4.5. It is important
to note that some simultaneity among the phases can occur.
The embryonic phase means that the organization starts to recognize the
benefits of project management — PM, usually by lower and middle levels of<p>
          <i>Table 4.3. Life cycle phase characteristics (Kezner, 2001)</i><br>

management. <p> 
Kerzner (2001) emphasizes the growth phase as the most critical, because it
is the beginning of the creation of the PM process, and warns that different
methodologies for each project should be avoided.
The last life cycle phase — maturity — is difficult to achieve due to several
factors such as organizational resistance to project cost control and horizontal
accounting. <p> 
The main characteristics of these life cycle phases emphasized by Kerzner
(2001) are described in Table 4.3. <p> 
          <p class="b">Organizational Project Management Maturity Model OPM3
              <div class="line"></div><p>
          More recently, the Project Management Institute, (PMI, 2003), concluded
the formulation of a maturity model called the OPM3, Organizational Project
Management Maturity Model.<p>
According to Schlichter et al. (2003), the PMI began to develop the OPM3 in
1998, using a team of volunteers. In 1999, in order to study existing maturity
models, the team applied a questionnaire to more than 30,000 professionals.
Formulating the model involved more than 700 volunteers until the beta version
of the OPM3 production was released in mid-2004, when the first complete
round of testing was completed at the end of the year
          </p></div><br>
      <div class="first"><p>
          According to the PMI (2003ª), the meaning of the OPM3, or organization
project management maturity model, can be defined as follows. Organizational increases the work domain, leaving the context of the project itself,
which is a matter for PMBoK. The use of the word maturity implies that the
capacities should grow during this period with that aim of producing repeated
success in project management. Maturity can be understood as total development or in perfect condition. Maturity also demonstrates understanding or
gives visibility to how success occurs and ways of correcting or preventing
common problems. The model implies change, a progression, or steps in a
process.
The following points show the strategic context of the OPM3 model (PMI,
2001b):<p>
          • Project management in an organization is not simply project management
methodology; this is PMBoK;<p>
• Its strategic domain includes more than systems for delivering multiple
projects of project management;<p>
• The model should join both activities that align projects to strategic
priorities and to the infrastructure that prepares the project environment;<p>
• The model should strengthen the link between organizational strategy and
execution making project results equal organizational success;<p>
• The model should include capacities that differentiate organizations that
can repeatedly translate organizational strategy and supply it with successful project results;<p>

         &nbsp;&nbsp; • Organizational routines can make projects responsive to strategic priorities, including the prioritization of projects, managing the project portfolio,
and managing the organizational environment.<p>
The OPM3 model starts with the concept of project’s life cycle, already
existing in PMBoK, as following: initiating processes, planning processes,
executing processes, controlling processes, and closing processes. Besides, the model classifies improvement stages:standardize, measure, control, and continuously improve. Finally, this maturity model considers three
constructs: project, program, and portfolio. Figure 4.6 shows the relation
among life-cycle processes, improvement stages, and constructs.<p>
After completing a company assessment, the results are displayed as shown in
Figure 4.7.
In spite of different approaches regarding the best practices in the project
management, there is a general consensus about the importance of the following
widely used efficiency models: the CMM (Humphrey, 1989; Paulk et al.,<p>
1995), the Project Management Maturity Model – PMMM (Kerzner, 2000;
2001); and the Project Management Body of Knowledge — PMBoK (PMI,
2000). All of them are empirical and were developed based on the best
practices used in real projects. Although they have different approaches in their
conception, they are rather more complementary than conflictive. These
models consider that maturity level is an organizational characteristic and it is
independent of the professionals involved.<p>

          A company belongs to the electric-electronic segment, which produces and
installs a great variety of electric and electronic equipments, with the great
majority delivered to customers through specific projects adapted to the
necessities of each one. The products innovation tax is extremely high and the
products actually sold were developed maximal three years ago. Besides, the<p>
          
         company sells customized solutions to their customers, demanding high delivered competence in the services. This approach reflects in the principal
company’s resource, the labor force and their coordinated work together with
the customers.<p>
Project management for this company is a crucial issue, because 50% of its
gross sales come from projects. It totalizes almost €32 billion in one fiscal year
in the whole world.
This company established project management office (PMO) responsible for
the elaboration of templates for project management main topics: contract
management, project control, personnel management, qualification’s program,
PM-tools, knowledge management, process for transference and implementation, project assessment, claim management, risk management, project procurement, and small projects. <p>Furthermore, the PMO functions encompass the
implementation of a project management-training program, the identification of
the capabilities to be developed and career. Finally, the PMO should have the
control of the program implementation status in the departments and also of the
hugest and most important projects.The main objectives of the project management program of the analyzed
company are: to have a systematic best practice sharing and standards in
project management, to have sufficient number of qualified project managers,
to uniform project culture throughout the company, and to achieve sustained
profitability.<p>
The actual status of this program achieves 17 different business units, participating in their implementation in the Mercosul region. There was a job for
creation of a single project management methodology for the company in the
whole Mercosul, with the aim to equalize the various methodologies existents
as well the knowledge and to clearly define all process steps.
The nonmonetary benefits for the company are clear for the 17 areas. Some of
them are:

          The investment in the program also seems to have a very high economical return
to the company. In the fiscal year of 2003/2004 it is calculated that the program
will cost R$500,000.00 or US$167,000.00 and will provide an economy of
R$10,000,000.00 or US$ 3,300,000.00 in the Mercosul region. Until December 2003, R$1,000,000.00 or US$330,000.00 was already obtained. It
shows a return of 20 times the amount invested by the company

          Furthermore, a new project was obtained because of the project management
methodology of the analyzed company. This new project is with a client that the
company has never made business. The value of this new project is
R$14,000,000.00 or US$4,700,000.00. Thus, project management also
improved the sales of the company!<p>

          An information technology company, which has approximately 500 employees,
is 30% located in distant geographical points. The company works with
infrastructure projects and system development in different market segments,
distributed like this: telecommunication (30%), manufacture (20%), retail
(25%), and finance and government (25%).<p>
The data-rising evaluation pointed to some lacks in maturity levels. Figure 4.8
represents the perception of the personal about the company maturity in project
management.<p>
In order to detail each phase analysis, four parameters was chosen. The
performance diagnosis of each variable is shown in Figure 4.9.
